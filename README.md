# COVID-19 Prediction Using Symptoms

### Welcome to the COVID-19 Prediction Using Symptoms! This web application predicts the likelihood of COVID-19 based on user-reported symptoms using advanced machine learning techniques.

## Features

- **Symptom Input:** Users can enter their symptoms through an intuitive form.
- **Risk Prediction:** The system predicts the likelihood of COVID-19 using a binary classification model.
- **Model Training:** The application utilizes a predictive model trained with multiple machine learning algorithms.
- **Data Source:** Training data is sourced from international government websites.
- **User Interface:** A simple and clean interface developed using Flask for easy interaction.

## How the Webpage Works

1. **Form Creation:** We create a web form using Flask and Python, allowing users to input their symptoms.
2. **Model Deployment:** The trained machine learning model is deployed alongside the web application.
3. **Prediction Process:** Each time a user submits their symptoms through the form, the model processes the input and predicts the likelihood of COVID-19 in the background.

## How It Is Useful

- **Early Detection:** For individuals with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy, symptoms may take 5-6 days to appear after infection, but it can take up to 14 days. Daily checking via the web form provides users with regular updates on their likelihood of having COVID-19.
- **Health Monitoring:** Regular results from the web form help users assess their risk and decide when to consult a doctor based on pre-predictions.
- **Early Intervention:** Identifying potential COVID-19 cases early allows individuals to seek medical advice sooner, potentially leading to faster recovery and better management of the illness.
